## Your Mission

Stop any project you currently have running; let's go back to the film application that you've started. You can run the app with `npm start`.

You're almost finished! Now, You need to:
- Show the details of each movie by getting this information from TMDB.
- Refactor your React app to make it as clean as possible.

### Task 1: Adding the API call

We'll use the 3rd party [Axios API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to handle our API calls.

You already have a function where you want the API call to go (`handleDetailsClick` - when a user clicks for details of a movie, you'll call the API to get those details), so your `axios` task will work inside that function. You've set up the rest of your app correctly.

#### Step 1: Set up the API key

This step seems complicated, but it isn't! Just take it one step at a time. Because TMDB isn't a public API, you'll need to get an API key to add to your `fetch()` call; then, you'll want to make sure to keep the key in a safe spot.

- To gain access to the TMDB API, you'll need to get an API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org).
  - TMDB only gives API keys to users with accounts, sou'll have to sign up first (it's free). However, it will ask for your phone and address.
  - Then, request an API key on your profile page ([further instructions](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)).
  - Once you have your API key, you need to include it in your app. Since you **never want to store app secrets in your repository**, you'll use the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) package to keep the API key in a local file.


- You'll need to install `dotenv`.
  - Run `npm install --save dotenv` on the command line to add the dependency to your `package.json` file
  - Create a new file at the **root** of your project called `.env.local` (accept the system warning).
  - In your `.env.local` file, add the line `REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=<Your TMDB API v3 KEY>`
  - Make sure that you restart youor React server.

*Note: The `.env.local` file is in your `.gitignore` by default when you create an app with `create-react-app`, so now your secret will never leak into your repository. It's important to note that since this is a front-end application, the built JavaScript will contain the key, which means end-users will be able to see it. However, that's fine for this practice app, since you'll only be running it locally.*

- Now you have an API key saved in `dotenv`. Now, point your application to it: add the following to the top of your `TMDB.js` file:

```js
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();
```

- And replace `'<REPLACE_THIS_WITH_TMDB_API_KEY>'` with `process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY`.

Your secrets are now set up!

#### Step 2: Make a `const` called `url` with the API's URL

Now that you have the API key to call for movie details, let's go back to making that call.

In your `App.js` `handleDetailsClick` method, add the following `const` right above your `setState`:

```JavaScript
const url = `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${film.id}?api_key=${TMDB.api_key}&append_to_response=videos,images&language=en`
```

This is the URL to which you'll send your request to get detailed information about each film. You're passing the `film.id` and the `TMDB.api_key` as query string parameters.

- *Note: Using `${film.id}` is a slightly faster shorthand for embedding variables in strings.*
  - *For example, `const myString = "The " + film.id + " is great"` is the same as writing `const myString = "The ${film.id} is great"`.*


#### Step 3: Make the API call with Axios

Run `npm install axios` and add `import axios from "axios"` to the top of `App.js`.

Now that you have the API key and URL set up, underneath the new URL variable, fetch the API.

```JavaScript
const url = `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${film.id}?api_key=${TMDB.api_key}&append_to_response=videos,images&language=en`

axios({
  method: 'GET',
  url: url
}).then(response => {
  console.log(response) // take a look at what you get back!
})
```

Try clicking a movie row in your browser - the data for it should appear in the console.

#### Step 4: Set the state when the API call completes

Let's now set your `current` state to be the object you get back from TMDB. Move the `setState` call into the API call.

```JavaScript
axios({
  method: 'GET',
  url: url
}).then(response => {
  console.log(response) // take a look at what you get back!
  console.log(`Fetching details for ${film.title}`);
  this.setState({ current: response.data })
})
```

Now, you have the API call to get information about your chosen movie.

### Task 2: Refactoring our app

Before you continue to display the movie details to the user, let's clean up your application.

Let's refactor any components that only have a `render()` method into functional components. Functional components are simpler and will gain performance benefits in future versions of React. It is considered good practice to use them wherever possible.

#### Step 1: Refactor `FilmPoster.js`

1. Replace the `class`/`extends` definition with a `function`. Remember that your function should accept a `props` argument.
2. Remove the `render()` method, keeping only the `return` function.
3. Replace all instances of `this.props` with simply `props`
4. Remove `{Component}` from the React `import` at the top since you no longer use it (but still import `React`).

Check in your browser to be sure the functionality hasn't changed.

#### Step 2: Refactor `FilmDetails`

You haven't written out the `FilmDetails` component yet, but it currently only renders UI. Therefore, you can also make it a functional component.

Follow the same steps as above, and once again check in the browser for functionality.

#### Step 3: Refactor `FilmRow`

The `FilmRow` component currently only renders UI. Therefore, you can also make it a functional component.

Follow the same steps as above, and once again check in the browser for functionality.


### Task 3: Adding Film Details

You're almost finished. Now, you'll render the film details you're receiving from the API (and currently logging to the console) in the browser window for the user.

#### Step 1: Add image URLs for `FilmDetails`

Above the `return`, add the following `const` definitions for fetching backdrop and posters:

```js
const backdropUrl = `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/${props.film.backdrop_path}`
const posterUrl = `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w780/${props.film.poster_path}`
```

#### Step 2: Render the empty case for `FilmDetails`

When the app loads, there is no film selected to display in `FilmDetails`. When a user clicks on a film in the `FilmListing`, you want to fetch and show the details. Thus, there are two scenarios for `FilmDetails`:
- The empty scenario (no film selected)
- The populated scenario (a film selected)

Start with the empty case. Add the following markup below the `.section-title`.

```html
<div className="film-detail">
  <p>
    <i className="material-icons">subscriptions</i>
    <span>No film selected</span>
  </p>
</div>
```

#### Step 3: Conditionally render the current film

To start, create a new variable to hold on to your DOM tree. You'll conditionally assign the value to this variable depending on whether or not there's a film object passed in through the props.

Add this below the two declared `const` variables:

```js
let details
```

Now, you need to determine if there is a film to render or not.

To do this, you just need to check if there's an `id` property on the `film` prop passed in to `FilmDetail`.
- If not, you want to render the empty case you added in the last step.
- Otherwise, you have a film to show, so you want to present the film details markup (don't copy this over yet):

```html
<div className="film-detail is-hydrated">
  <figure className="film-backdrop">
    <img src={backdropUrl} alt="" />
    <h1 className="film-title">{props.film.title}</h1>
  </figure>

  <div className="film-meta">
    <h2 className="film-tagline">{props.film.tagline}</h2>
    <p className="film-detail-overview">
      <img src={posterUrl} className="film-detail-poster" alt={props.film.title} />
      {props.film.overview}
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

- Your task here is to conditionally assign the film details block of markup to the `details` variable if there is a current `id`.
  - If there is not a current `id`, instead render the JSX for the empty case.
- You still want to keep your `section-title`, which isn't part of this conditional.
  - Therefore, the `return` statement of your `FilmDetails` function should finally look like this:

```html
return (
  <div className="film-details">
    <h1 className="section-title">Details</h1>
    {detail}
  </div>
)
```


## Taking it further

Here are some optional things you can do to deepen your knowledge and take this app further:

- Refactor `Fave` into a functional component.
- Move the filters into a `FilmListingFilter` component.
- Implement client-side routing to show multiple pages of films.
- Go through the CSS and see how the app is styled (it uses both flexbox and CSS Grid).
- Add a textarea for a review to each film detail and save that on the film object.
- Show an icon in `FilmListing` for all films with reviews.
- Show the `fave` state of a film on `FilmDetails`.
- Add any other features you can think of!
